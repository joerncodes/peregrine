# Peregrine â€” Lightning fast self-hosted image library

**Peregrine** is a modern, self-hosted image library that lets you upload, search, and manage images with a beautiful, responsive web interface. It features drag-and-drop uploads, instant search, and image management powered by a fast backend and Meilisearch.

---

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Uploads:** Effortlessly upload images by dragging them onto the app.
- **Instant Search:** Lightning-fast, full-text search across your image library.
- **Image Management:** View, zoom, download, and copy images to your clipboard.
- **Tagging & Metadata:** Images are stored with titles, descriptions, and tags.
- **Self-Hosted:** All your images stay on your own server.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

---

## How It Works

- **Frontend:** React app (Vite, Tailwind CSS) for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express server handles uploads, search, and image serving.
- **Search Engine:** Meilisearch provides fast, typo-tolerant search.
- **Storage:** Images are saved to the server's filesystem (`public/images/`).
